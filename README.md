### 1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

We used tools of visualization such as free-flow provided on mac os software. We realize needed to manifest the invisible as we created the game through a combination of a script, user input and our current code.

### 2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

We would add voice for an intro using ideas from beatbox. We would also develop the personality of the game by giving the computer some spicy oneliners as well as return statements for the user regarding specific scenerios such as a flawless victory.

### 3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We used ping pong, driver-navigator, independent coding and a leader-follower appraoch.

For ping pong, we were both actively engaged contributing solutions and code through tuple. In driver navigator, one person drove as the other navigated. For independent work, I wrote test and solved methods, pushed up to git hub, and my partner would continue. In a leader-follower approach specifically for iteration 3, the leader would direct where the technical skill level varied and was not feasable due to time constraints to finish the project. Feedback and questions were asked in real time to understand project direction and end goal.

### 4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
